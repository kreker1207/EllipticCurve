# Elliptic Curves
An elliptic curve in cryptography is a mathematical structure used to implement various cryptographic protocols and algorithms, including asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, and key exchange. Elliptic curves are based on the mathematical properties of elliptic curves over a field of finite simple order. They consist of points that satisfy a special equation according to a defined algebraic structure. Elliptic curves over a field of finite order are used in cryptography, which provides resistance to various attacks.

## Assignment
Write wrapper functions for your chosen library that will allow you to perform basic transformations with EC points in a way that is convenient for you.

## Installation
**To run the project, you need to install Go on your computer. Download and install Go from the official Go website (https://golang.org). Choose the version of Go that is appropriate for your operating system and architecture.**

1. Project cloning:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kreker1207/EllipticCurve.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Build Maven
```bash
mvn install
```
This command - compile, build and install the build result
4. Run project via your IDE
In this project was used Spring framework to create a dependency with library that is working with Elliptic curves
